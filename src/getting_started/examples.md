## Tips for Writing Scripts

1. **Always import from bridge:** `from bridge import *`
2. **Use async/await:** Most bridge methods return awaitables
3. **Name your event handlers after the event:** `async def block_break(event)` handles `block_break` events
4. **Commands auto-register:** The function name becomes the command name
5. **Cancel events to prevent default behavior:** `event.cancel()`
6. **Use the `Config` class for persistence** instead of global dictionaries
